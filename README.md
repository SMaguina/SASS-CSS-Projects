This repository contains different web projects and practicals done to gain an advanced understanding of using SASS. As a front-end developer, it is an essential tool for time efficiency and improved web performance when rendering stylesheets. So, I am to continally learn more about it's features and benefits on an advanced level. The best way to do so is to actually create more web projects using it! Below are a few notes and summaries of strategies learned throughout the process to help me refer back to:
